Title: About

Intro: Most restaurant reviews focus on just one part of the dining experience: the food. Just as important as the food is everything else — the branding, website, exterior design, interior design, furnishings, tableware, menu design, service, “vibe,” and music. For us an exceptional dining-out experience is one where everything is considered — where all the senses are engaged, not just the taste buds.

About: Hungry for Design is the opinion of Susan Battista and Fritz Klaetke — partners in both work and life. By day they run (link:http://visualdialogue.com text:Visual Dialogue popup:yes), a design firm creating branding and websites for restaurants and hospitality groups and by night, they can be found sharing meals (and opinions) at restaurants all over Boston and beyond.
