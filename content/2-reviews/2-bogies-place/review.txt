Text: When you see “adults only” on a restaurant website, it raises some questions. Is this a strip club?
Well, Bogie’s place is not far from the old Combat Zone in Downtown Crossing but the strip in this case is NY Strip—it’s a steak place.

You enter by going through the bar and duck into a hidden room in the back of jm Curley’s. The anticipation of what’s on the other side of the curtain is exciting. IBut once inside, you see that it’s a missed opportunity. We wanted the interior to look like it’s been there for 80 years. While it’s trying to be a “Speakeasy,” it doesn’t do it well. When you think “Speakeasy”, you imagine rich textures and leather and a dark colors. It might have been interesting for them to use old plates and silverware with mixed patterns to carry the depression-era theme through to all touch points. They definitely needed to add some patterns and textures to make the place look historically correct and inviting. So much opportunity with the interior but it wasn’t carried through. Old paintings or photos on the walls would have been an inexpensive way to add some life to the room. The only art you see here is in the restroom—there’s a photo of Richard Nixon bowling—not we’re not sure what the connection is there.

And why the flat screen TV over the bar—no TVs in the 20’s people! A big old wooden radio would have looked great (and a iPod could have been inserted to play jazz standards). Or better yet, a stand-up piano in the corner with a pianist clad in a white shirt with sleeve garters playing for our entertainment. The owners should take a road trip with the owners to the Ace Hotel in NYC to see how this kind of thing can be done well—how a theme is carried through. Actually, all they need to do is watch an episode of  Boardwalk Empire on HBO—lots of ideas there.

On a high note, the service was great. The bartender seems like the kind of guy who would have run a place like this back in the day. The menu is simple and tasty. The place has so much potential and is not getting the buzz it could as a result of not “sparing a dime” on the branding and interior design throughout the joint.
