Text: Boston’s waterfront is in the middle of a development boom with new buildings sprouting up like weeds. Drive by after not being in the neighborhood for a few weeks and you’ll see a new tower in the skyline or a crane working on the next one. While we question the urban planning and architecture behind a row of similar-looking hotels, this area is undeniably in the midst of transformation. So with this influx of residents, office workers, and visitors, a restaurant boom has happened as well. Step inside a generic glass office building near the the Institute of Contemporary Art and suddenly you’ve been transported to Vegas. Empire—an Asian-themed restaurant has a big, bold, glitzy, no-expenses sparred feel that seems more at home on the Strip then Northern Ave. An we like it.  The restaurant is owned by Big Night Entertainment Group that owns Ra couple restaurants at Foxwoods—which may explain the Casino feel. Too many restaurants in Boston feel the interior design is an afterthought, but here it’s front and center and in your face.

Metallics and vivid colors through the use of rich textiles, patterns and accessories set the opulent tone throughout the lounge, main dining room, bar areas, and private dining rooms. But it takes more that a good looking restaurant to make for a good experience and Empire may want to “deal” with a few things. When we first arrived, the place was empty and we asked to sit in a booth. The hostess told us we couldn’t sit in a booth because they are the best seats in the house and escorted us to a table. Guess we don’t look like “high rollahs.”  Suggested attire for booth-seating must be stilettos and sequins (upon leaving 90 minutes later, all booths remained empty). Make sure you’ve had a fluoride treatment before you get a drink there. The drinks were so sickening sweet they tasted like Now and Later candy (we actually sent them back—a very rare occurrence—and asked for a gin and tonic). The portions were huge—reminiscent of an “all you can eat buffet where quantity wins over quality.” So while no expenses were spared with the interior and branding, Empire does not deal a winning hand with the service, specialty drinks, or food. We’d call the experience a bust.
