Text: Cambridge Massachusetts is often thought of as Boston’s smart and funky sister city across the Charles river. A community of dense squares (see our campaign Cambridge is for Squares) Cambridge’s heart is Harvard Square, home to a certain university, Broadway-bound theatre (A.R.T.), diverse shops, and street performers. But with the exception of a few standouts, not a great restaurant destination…until recently.

The space below the Brattle Theatre that had been the home to beloved restaurant Casablanca for over 40 years had been transformed by chef/owner Michael Scelfo into one of the best new restaurants to open this year, Alden & Harlow.

What we liked immediately was the fact that the large open space was set up in a number of smaller more intimate spaces with a large active bar in the middle of all the action. You could sit in an atrium area under a glass roof surrounded by a living wall of plants, dine at comfy booths across from the bar, or head to the back dining room across from the open kitchen and surrounded by large windows. While the old Casablanca space felt dark and subterranean, the interior design team has been been able to re-invent the space in a way that somehow feels both open and alive. A mix of materials was used throughout—metal, wood, tile, leather—for an industrial yet warm feel in each of the distinct areas. The crowd was a lively mix of all the usual suspects you’d expect in Harvard Square—students, seniors, professors, tourists, families, hipsters, and hippies. The lighting and music complimented the mood—now it’s time to look at the menu. A very pleasant and attentive waitress told us that the dishes were tapas style with lighter items on left of the menu getting heavier as you read to the right (i.e. snacks to entrees). We were each given a drink menu (thank you!—why are those drink menus so precious that you usually only get one to share at a table) and started selecting our dishes. When’s the last time you looked at a menu and there were so many items that looked good it was difficult to decide which to order.

Plated on an eclectic array of unmatched plates, each dish was perfectly timed to follow the previous in a choreographed manner. So many standouts on the menu. Go ahead and order an extra plate or two of food and skip dessert. On both occasions we dined there, dessert was the only disappointing part of the meal. But that’s ok, there’s a lot of great places to get ice cream and sweets in Harvard Square.
